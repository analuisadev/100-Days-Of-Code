<br> Day 38: Program for reading notes, sum, average and order reversal using Lists.
<br> Day 39: In an exercise I created a program where the user can enter several numerical values and register them in a list. If the number already exists inside, it will not be added. At the end, all the unique values entered will be displayed, in ascending order.
<br> Day 40: In this exercise I created based on some commands that I learned to change the elements of the list using integers.
